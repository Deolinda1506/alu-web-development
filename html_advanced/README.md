Advanced HTML Project
In this project, we will create a web page using only HTML based on a designer file available on Figma. The main goal is to focus on HTML structure and ensure good semantics without worrying about styling.

Designer file on Figma
we can access the designer file on Figma by following this link: Page in Figma.

Create a Figma account if you still need to get one to access the design details and policies used.

Important notes with Figma
If our computer does not have the policies used, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT.
Some values float; do not hesitate to round them according to your needs.
