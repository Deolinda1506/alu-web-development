### Advanced HTML Project
In this project, we will create a web page using only HTML based on a designer file available on Figma. The main goal is to focus on HTML structure and ensure good semantics without worrying about styling.

### Designer file on Figma
we can access the designer file on Figma by following this link: Page in Figma.

### Create a Figma account if you still need to get one to access the design details and policies used.

### Important notes with Figma
If our computer does not have the policies used, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT.
Some values float; do not hesitate to round them according to your needs.
